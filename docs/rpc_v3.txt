Design ideas for RPCv3:
1. Must be something more defined than RPCv2, preferrably something with libraries available for client (C++, multi-platform) and server (CodeIgniter or PHP). Currently thinking some kind of XML.

2. Needs to include the following pieces of data from client to server:
Hostname
RPC server token
RPC client token
client version
what OS the client is running on
whether the client can apply updates
whether the client can apply a reboot
whether the system needs a reboot (yes, no or unknown)
whether the client attempted to apply a reboot
list of available updates (if any)
for each available update:
name of the package or component (or update description for Windows)
version number (if available)
unique ID for update (the client will expect this when returning accepted updates)
whether the update will require a reboot (yes, no or unknown)

3. Needs to include the following pieces of data from server to client:
RPC server token
RPC client token
whether a reboot was requested
list of accepted updates (if any)
for each accepted update:
unique ID for update
